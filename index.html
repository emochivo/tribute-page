  <title> Our One And Only GD! </title>

  <h1> G-DRAGON </h1>
  <h2> The Greatest of All Time in K-Pop History </h2>

  <h3> Part 1 </h3>
  <p> G-Dragon (real name: Kwon Ji-yong) is a rapper, songwriter, composer, and the leader of K-pop legendary boy group BIGBANG. G-Dragon's stage name was based on his real name: G (Ji) and Dragon, which is "Yong" in Korean. </p>
  <p> G-Dragon has been working in the entertainment industry since little, when he was a member of a tribute group to a Korean band named Roo'ra. </p>
  <p> He participated in a dance competition and caught the attention from Lee Soo-man, the founder of SM Entertainment. G-Dragon was a trainer in SM for 5 years, before being persuaded by Yang Hyun-suk, the founder of YG Entertainment and also the former member of Seo Taiji and Boys. </p>
  <p> After doing some other training for another 6 years, in August 18th, 2006, our GD finally debuted in a 5-member hip hop boy group, BIGBANG!! </p>

  <h3> Part 2 </h3>
  <p> BIGBANG debuted with the song called "La La La" (highly recommended if you're into old school hip-hop :>) but it wasn't a very big hit at that time, and they actually in the state of being "nugu" (not known by the public) for 1 year until 2007, when they came back with the song "Lies." </p>
  <p> "Lies" instantly stayed #1 at every song chart in Korea, becoming one of the biggest hits in the Korean music history. This song also received the daesang (roughly translated to "great award") Song of the Year by MKMF (the former name of MAMA) and also Best Song Award by Seoul Music Awards. </p>
  <p> The writer and the composer of the song, is no one else but G-Dragon!</p>
  <p> "Lies" was supposed to be a GD-solo song, but after submitting the song to Yang Hyun-suk for evaluation, GD was told to make it a group song instead. Upset at first, but he finally gave the song to BIGBANG, and created a whole path for the group, leading to the top of the K-pop history. </p>
